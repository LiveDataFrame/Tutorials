    "## How to add Realtime Indicators to Crypto Market Data in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will show you how to add indicators to cryptocurrency market data in Python. Indicators are statistics of price/volume data used to measure current market conditions as well as to forecast trends. Basically, they generate trading signals and are a piece of the broader trading strategy that also involves risk and portfolio management. Common indicators are the [RSI](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rsi.asp) and [MACD](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/macd.asp)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we will accomplish:**\n",
    "1. Create our first indicator (SMA) and plot the results.\n",
    "2. Use LiveDataFrame to do this in realtime, across many coins\n",
    "3. Filter for new oppurtunities\n",
    "4. Create a Momentum Strategy using the RSI indicator"
