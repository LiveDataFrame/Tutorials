    "What we did above was pretty cool. We subscribed to a stream of realtime trade data from binance, made it easy to read, and performed a simple calculation on it. But there was a lot of work that we had to do to get there. What if we had to do this for every exchange? A lot of time evaluating the market would be spent getting stuck on issues like dealing with numbers as strings, or cryptic 'is buyer market maker' type fields. Every exchange is different too. \n",
