    "### Purpose of this tutorial\n",
    "To create a customizable alerting tool to monitor volume changes accross all bittrex coins using LiveDataFrame\n",
    "    \n",
    "### What you will be creating:\n",
    "An augmented trading tool that monitors volume changes accross an entire cryptocurrency exchange (bittrex) that:\n",
    "  - Monitors all the coins in realtime\n",
    "  - Has customizable alert criteria for volume change % and time (e.g \"Alert when a coin's volume changes 10% in 10 minutes\")\n",
    "  - Plays a sound when customizable alert criteria is fulfilled\n",
    "  - Displays a list of coins fulfilling the alert/volume criteria and a link to their chart.\n",
    "  - Updates this list, checks volume changes of coins, and alerts and prints the list automatically every 7 seconds\n",
